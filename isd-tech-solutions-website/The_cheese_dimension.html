Success in a free-market system depends on good things like intelligence and motivation and not icky things like nobility and class.
 That’s why America is better than Britain. But if Americans are so damn smart, then why can’t they make good cheese?
Simple, because they don’t have to. When the Europeans stop making cheese,
 then you’ll soon see just how serious Americans can get about cheese making.
  We can do it. I know we can. We did it with pretzels.

Other ongoing questions: “Do Americans really have worse taste than Europeans?”
Well, if you’re talking about car steering wheels, then yes.  
And I don’t know who has better fashion sense, but it sure can’t be the Japanese. 
Not unless you’re into clothes that are more neon than your child’s lunch box. 
And I’m not saying I’m not. But the cheese question continues to ferment. 
Why is mass produced cheese so popular over here? Does it sell in Europe or do they all eat Roquefort and Gorgonzola for lunch every day? 
Well, actually they do. But I did see a commercial on Italian television for Philadelphia cream cheese. At first I thought less of them for it, 
but then I totally changed my mind.

Then I wondered what would a musical genius like Louis Armstrong have said about all this? I mean, 
can you imagine Pops asking for 'just a smidgeon of gorgonzola?’ But then again, he was a musical genius. 
You say sun-dried tom-ay-to, I say sun-dried tom-ah-to. Ze bop ze gorganzola zabidee brie.
